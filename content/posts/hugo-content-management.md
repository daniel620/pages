# Hugo Content Management Guide

This post explains how Hugo manages content and what editing options you have.

## Content Structure

```
content/
├── _index.md          # Homepage
├── about.md           # About page
└── posts/             # Blog posts
    ├── post1.md
    └── post2.md
```

## Editing Options

### 1. Direct File Editing
- Edit Markdown files directly in your editor
- Run `hugo server` to preview changes locally
- Deploy when ready

### 2. GitHub Integration
The `BookEditPath` in config enables "Edit this page" links that take you to GitHub's web editor.

### 3. CMS Integration Options
- **Netlify CMS**: Web-based editor for static sites
- **Forestry**: Git-based CMS with preview
- **Decap CMS**: Open source headless CMS

### 4. Local Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
hugo server

# Create new post
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md

# Build for production
hugo
```
