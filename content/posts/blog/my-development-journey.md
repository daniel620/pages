# My Development Journey

Reflecting on my path as a software developer.

## How It Started

I began programming with simple HTML pages and gradually moved to more complex technologies.

## Key Milestones

- **2020**: First HTML/CSS website
- **2021**: Learned JavaScript and React
- **2022**: Backend development with Node.js
- **2023**: Cloud deployment and DevOps
- **2024**: Microservices architecture
- **2025**: AI and machine learning integration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start small**: Don't try to learn everything at once
2. **Practice daily**: Consistency beats intensity
3. **Build projects**: Theory without practice is useless
4. **Join communities**: Learning with others accelerates growth
5. **Stay curious**: Technology evolves rapidly

## Current Focus

- Cloud-native applications
- Container orchestration
- Developer experience optimization
- Building scalable systems

## What's Next?

Planning to explore:
- Serverless architectures
- Edge computing
- WebAssembly
- Quantum computing basics
